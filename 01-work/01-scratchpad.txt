August

mondial=#	equal sign means we're at prompt
mondial-#	dash means we're in a query that hasn't been completed with an ;

\?		list all the commands
\l		list databases
\l+		list databases with size
\conninfo	display information about current connection
\c database	connect to new database, e.g., \c template1
\d		check the database tables or schema
\d tablename	
\dt 		list tables of the public schema
\dt schemaname.* 	list tables of certain schema, e.g., \dt public.*
\dt *.* 		list tables of all schemas
Then you can run SQL statements, e.g., SELECT * FROM my_table;
(Note: a statement must be terminated with semicolon ;)
  
\q		quit psql


Query Ideas Homework:
independence against economy (gdp or inflation) and that of neighbors
languages shared across borders
was intrigued by "alternative province names" but that ended up a very shallow list
