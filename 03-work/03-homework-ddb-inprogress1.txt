Here are the extra credit questions. I have changed the scoring and added new options. 
You can get up to a total of five extra points so don't do everything! Choose some of these. 
No need to do them in order, skip if it is too perplexing, and interpret them however you like.

Thanks to the students who posed these question!!!
