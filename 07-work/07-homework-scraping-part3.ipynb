    "## Homework 3 Part Two: Scraping\n",
    "This homework asks you to scrape from two different sources: Supreme Court Decisions and a more complicated version of Shakespeare (bonus). \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, please follow the instructions and do the best you can. Look at the tutorial for examples, as well as the Beautiful Soup documentation, and any other Python resource (such as Stack overflow). As you get further into this assignment a lot of the trick will be using loops properly and appending information into lists. One of the great ways to carefully use Beautiful Soup is to first use find() to find the first instance of something and search through it. And then use find_all() to get a list of results that you must then loop throughIn search within.\n",
