Aseem technique:
	miranda = soup_doc.find_all('div')[3].li
	for line in miranda.strong.find_next_siblings(string=True):
    		print(line)

YiYin (TA) technique:
	soup_doc = BeautifulSoup(raw_html, "html.parser")
	for line in soup_doc.findAll('div')[3].find('ul').find_all(string=True):
   	 if line.find("\n")!=-1:
      	  print(line)



strip_string

get_text, by comparison, gets all text and tosses tags (good for html that has some structure, but it's mostly poor)
	variable = blah.blah.get_text('||uniquestring||',strip=True)

	generator
		a grouping of results that can be iterated through like a list, but not used like a list
	set
